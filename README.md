# Pixel_Logic_Task

-I used Selenium and TestNG.
-I run the tests test by test.
-5 tests succeeded and 2 failed.
-There are screenshots of the successful tests.
-I wouldn't able to complete the whole task as I got stuck I didn't know how to use Http Interceptor after a long search.
-In the task of customized reports I used Ashot but when I run it in my project it gives an error.

-There are two classes seleniumPage class which contain the functions that access the website page and another class TestNG which contain the tests and it inherits from SeleniumPage class.

Thank you.
